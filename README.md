- Welcome to MERN Projects for Beginners, where you learn to build awesome web apps using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) framework. This stack is in high demand in the startup sector because you can make a fully functional web app using it.

A front-end engineer who knows HTML, CSS, and React can quickly learn Node.js and MongoDB and build a fully production-ready web app.

In this book, you learn how to host a back end using Node.js code in Heroku. The front-end site uses React code and Firebase hosting. It is also hosted through a cloud database called MongoDB Atlas. Most of the hosting setups are the same in the next five
chapters, so it wonâ€™t be repeated in most chapters.
